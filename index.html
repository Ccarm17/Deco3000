						<p>Undulate is an interactive exhibit designed to allow participants to ‘take the emotional pulse of UQ.’ The rolling structure listens to mentions of UQ related hashtags on Twitter, and creates light and sound in response. Through sound users can hear the average sentiment expressed recently, and the lights each represent an individual sentiment. As sentiments come in through Twitter they are propagated through the structure. This combination of time, light and sound shows the speed of the Twitter conversation, while expressing it in a novel and directly emotional way. The use of social media allows users to directly interface with the installation, as well as to do so incidentally.</p>

						<h3 id="undulateprocess">Design Process</h3>
						<p>
							The team behind Undulate is comprised of architecture, music and IT students. We met weekly to work on the project conceptually. Early on in the process we settled on the tagline of ‘take the emotional pulse of UQ,’ which informed our decisions going forward. The team naturally split into three sub-teams based along school lines, with architecture, music, and IT students working mostly independently, and with whole team meetings occurring weekly. The shared vision for the project allowed for a certain level of independence without enough divergence to cause serious issues. The project went through many iterations before settling on it’s final form, the most formative of which are covered below.
						</p>

						<h4>Process - built form</h4>
						<p>
							The built form of the structure went through many iterations.
							<ol>
								<li>
									A field of small flowers stuck in the ground. Each flower would light up and produce sound, and be associated with one sentiment.
									<ul>
										<li>This was considered unacceptable as the risk of users damaging the components was too high.</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									A reciprocal structure ‘cave’ hanging above a walkway. This essentially moves the field above the users, reducing the risk of them damaging the structure. Lights are now strung along the structure, so users can look up to see the ‘flowers.’
									<ul>
										<li>This was unacceptable due to potential danger to the users of the structure collapsing on them, and subsequently the difficulty of getting the structure certified.</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									While retaining the construction method, the structure moved to the ground. Now instead of users walking under the structure they walk around the structure, reducing the risk to both users and the structure. This differs from the original flower design in that it is now one structure with lights strung instead of individual flowers which can be easily removed or damaged.
									<ul>
										<li>Risks were identified of the structure being damaged by users, but this risk was considered acceptable as it was less likely than with the original ‘field’ design.</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ol>
						</p>

						<h4>Process - sentiments</h4>
						<p>
							We knew that emotions needed to be collected from users to be encoded into light and sound. A number of designs were considered.
							<ol>
								<li>
									A survey screen. Users can input their emotion manually on a 1-10 scale.
									<ul>
										<li>We identified that users may not be reliable indicators of their own emotional state, and may not want to publicly express their emotion, so looked for something less explicit.</li>
										<li>A few more ideas came about such as users putting a token in a well, which represented their emotion, but ultimately these were merely different interfaces for the same interaction.</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									Scan people’s faces when they walk in. Use cloud computing to ascertain their emotion.
									<ul>
										<li>The privacy concern here are atrocious, and the idea was quickly dismissed. In a gallery or similar space where participants can be made aware of the use of their data this could be interesting, but in a public outdoor thoroughfare this would have too many risks.</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									Collect emotions from social media, and use sentiment analysis to determine emotion.
									<ul>
										<li>We could only collect public information, reducing the privacy concerns.</li>
										<li>Relies on the users having access to social media.</li>
										<li>We considered this risk acceptable, and considering this would allow a more natural communication with the installation, went for this option.</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ol>

						<h3 id="undulatereflection">Reflection</h3>
						<p>
							The project was a success in that it demonstrated that the core interaction worked and could be applied further. The installation has several areas of improvement identified which could further the breadth and depth of interaction. The ability to have the installation active and improving for a week was invaluable.
						</p>

						<h4>Reflection - architecture</h4>
						<p>
							It would improve the project to have more sturdy building materials. Children especially wanted to climb on the structure, which would have been dangerous considering the fragile ply the structure was made of.
						</p>
						<p>
							Similarly, scaling the installation up would allow it to be enjoyed by people of various sizes. This would create an interesting feedback loop of the structure being fun to play on, and influencing emotions of participants, who can then make social media posts about the structure, which inform the colour and sound of the installation.
						</p>

						<h4>Reflection - software</h4>
						<p>
							While initially I had hoped to gather sentiments from a variety of social medias (most importantly Instagram, which appears the most popular among students) it was quickly clear that only Twitter was easily accessible. Twitter appears to be the least used social media among students, but I thought even so there would be enough activity to create interesting movement throughout the installation. To ensure there would be movement, I used as many UQ related hashtags as I could find (although unfortunately I couldn’t use #UQ, as most of the #UQ tweets were for the company UQ Mobile). During the installation it became clear that even with all the UQ related hashtags the velocity of incoming tweets was too low to create a sense of movement across the installation (a generous estimate would be 20 per night). There were many people who wanted to interact, but didn’t have a Twitter account, or had an account but didn’t have the app anymore, and otherwise couldn’t use their devices to engage with the installation.
						</p>
						<p>
							I wanted to set up a tablet where users could input their emotion manually on a 1-10 scale, but left the idea too late to implement successfully in time. This would have given non-Twitter-users the opportunity to engage with the installation while still preserving the social media based experience. This could be developed further by getting users to input messages with sentiment analysis, to avoid the issue of misrepresented sentiments, and potentially these messages could be Tweeted out to contribute to the Twitter ecosystem around the project.
						</p>

						<h4>Reflection - week-long installation</h4>
						<p>
							We strongly benefited from the time-frame of the project going over a week. This allowed for incremental improvements to the project, and an overall more agile approach. Our project was not in a complete form on day one, and small changes were made between days, and even during the open-time of the installation. If our installation was only open for one day none of this would have been possible, and our installation would have suffered for it.

						<h2>Floral Symphony</h2>

								<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="website/images/fs00.jpg" alt="Floral Symphony" /></span></div>
							</div>
						</div>
						<h3 id="floralintroduction">Introduction</h3>
						<p><em>Floral Symphony</em> was one of three interactive installations created as part of a special topic course undertaken in Semester 2, 2019. This project was a collaboration between Interaction Design, Music, and Architecture students, and was intended to explore what can be achieved through interdisciplinary collaboration. </p>
						<p><em>Floral Symphony</em> was deployed from Monday, 21 October, until Friday, 25 October, from 4pm - 8pm as part of the 2019 UQ Bloom festival.</p>

						<h3 id="floralconcept">Concept</h3>
						<p>
							Floral Symphony is a collaborative interactive musical experience. Users compose music through a proximity-based interaction, working together to create more complex compositions. The installation is comprised of a wall fitted with a number of interactive flowers. Each flower is fitted with an active proximity sensor that controls the volume of different audio elements, changing based on the distance of a user’s hand from the opening of a flower. Musical elements that play from flowers are designed to harmonise, and allow users to work together to create their own unique compositions. 

						</p>
						<p>
							Flowers are suspended from a wall structure that offer affordance for six flowers. This allows for up to six users to actively interact at once, and while individual users are able to play with the installation, the experience becomes more rich as participant numbers increase. This concept is intended to explore a scalable group interaction, and was created to explore collaborative interaction whilst simultaneously providing a novel experience for users.

						</p>
						<p>
							The initial idea for the deployed installation was a vertically curved wall - with a form reminiscent of a wave - with a number of hanging bunches of 3D printed flowers suspended from the top. Flowers would be in bunches of six, supported by beams or struts protruding from the top of the wall. Bunches of flowers would hang down from these at a height that average users would be able to interact with using their hands. The wall would have three bunches of flowers spaced evenly along it.
						</p>
						<p>
							The physical structure of the final installation resembled a wall. The purpose of the wall was to serve as a structure to hang interactive components from. It was a convex structure comprised of five curved modules that were secured together to create a frame resembling a large number two. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Audio elements were created by music students. Sound was played on a continuous loop within the flowers, with volume altered dependent on the proximity of a user’s hand. As a user’s hand got closer to the flower, music got louder. Audio tracks were created to be played in sync in order to create a harmonious sonic composition. Music was designed to attract participants and create a playful and exciting sonic experience. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Interactions are proximity based, with users producing music by moving their hands back and forwards in front of the opening of flowers. Based on the distance of the user’s hand from the opening, the volume of the music coming from the flower changes - increasing the closer the user’s hand is. Multiple users working together create more intricate and interesting compositions. 
						</p>

						<h3 id="floralprocess">Process</h3>
						<p>
							The process that lead to the final concept, physical structure, and interaction was quite volatile, and involved many iterations that resulted in drastic changes. Concepts that were discarded without significantly influencing the final installation will not be discussed here. The final concept and deployment site was confirmed in Week 11, but continued to evolve even throughout the final deployment.

						</p>
						<p>
							Inspiration for the final installation stemmed from earlier discussions of a Shadow Monsters-like installation. Users would become part of the installation through physical proximity to the wall, and have an avatar within a virtual environment representing them. This concept explored an evolutionary interaction where avatars would evolve or change based on a user’s behaviour. This installation relied upon a back-projected display on a canvassed wall, which was not suitable as part of the deployment was originally during the day, introducing heavy light pollution. The concept was simplified as the project timeline became more restrictive, and consequently, the ideas of back-projection and a virtual environment were discarded. The wall as the physical structure was carried over into the final concept.
						</p>
						<p>
							A wall was selected as the physical structure as collaboration with the E-Motion group had led to the two installations being designed to complement each other. Additional considerations such as space limitations at the original deployment location and requirements from P&F also made a wall the most logical choice. The original idea was that both installations would be deployed on either side of the path that E-Motion was deployed near, and would be joined by an arch crossing over the pre-existing path. These two concepts would each explore a different aspect of an environmental message related to data accessible from UQ (e.g. parking, energy usage, water quality).
						</p>
						<p>
							Further ideation resulted in the two groups diverging. The project team was unable to conceptualise how this data would be incorporated compellingly into an interactive installation. As a result, the idea of interactive flowers was arrived upon. This stemmed from other works such as <a href="https://vimeo.com/102667168">The Interactive Garden</a> as well as discussions around how a collaborative and thematically appropriate experience could be created for users. 
						</p>

						<h3 id="floralcomponents">Interactive Components - Flowers</h3>
						<p>
							The interactive components of the installation were an abstract interpretation of jacaranda flowers. The corollas were modelled in Rhinoceros 3D, then 3D printed in the Flashforge Guider II (3D printer). Cores to go inside the flower shells were created in a similar fashion to house electronic components.  
						</p>

						<h4>Flower Models</h4>
						<p>
							Flowers were chosen as the interactive component of the installation due to the theme of the Bloom festival. Initially, models were intended to closely resemble jacaranda flowers, but final designs were more abstract (see Flower B). The range of alternative designs explored was quite limited due to the week turnaround time on 3D printing coupled with the late finalisation of the concept. Initially, there was uncertainty around whether modelling and printing flowers within the limited timeline was possible. Some alternatives were explored to in case this was not possible. 
						</p>
						<p>
							In Week 11, attempts were made to create 3D jacaranda flowers by heat-forming a 2mm translucent opal acrylic sheet. This turned out to be more challenging than anticipated due to difficulty in manipulating the acrylic to the desired shape. The project team also explored the option of modelling flowers from wire and fabric. Unfortunately, this did not produce a product of an acceptable quality - in terms of aesthetics and durability - and was quickly dismissed as an option.

						</p>
						<p>
							The Architecture students designed two flower models in Rhinoceros 3D.

							<div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="website/images/fs2.png" alt="" /></span></div>
						</div>
						<p>
							Flower B was selected due to time constraints and a more practical design - in terms of being printable and more robust than Flower A. The printed flower shells needed to house, hide, and protect the electronic components that would be inserted, and fit the previously designed core component inside. Flower B had a visually stimulating design that would look interesting when illuminated from within, and the project timeline did not offer much room for experimentation.

							<div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="website/images/fs4.png" alt="" /></span></div>
						</div>
						<p>
							Two copies of four different flower designs were 3D printed in UQ Innovate over week 11 and 12. 

						</p>

						<h4>Electronic Core</h4>
						<p>
							A core was designed to house all electronic components, whilst also fitting inside flower shells. The core was modelled to fit electronic components precisely, and hang inside flower shells. Electronic components such as the ESP32 microcontroller and battery were placed in the head of the core, with the speaker in a chamber below. An ultrasonic proximity sensor was initially going to be attached to the bottom of the core that would be used to control the volume of music playing, but this did not eventuate. Each of the cores were wrapped with a strip of 18 NeoPixel LEDs.

							<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="website/images/fs6.png" alt="" /></span></div>
						</div>
						<p>
							It was proposed that the flowers were fully self-contained to reduce wiring, and by extension, easier to install and remove each day. This was also more thematically appropriate, as having wires running from flowers would not fit with their organic nature. The main requirements for speakers were that they would be able to continuously play for at least four hours without needing recharging and have audio cable. Anko speakers were chosen as they fit all the aforementioned criteria.

							</div>
						</div>
						<p>
							The main purpose of the structure was to act as a wall to hang the interactive components from. Ideally, the flowers would hang at a height that most users could comfortably interact with. Architecture students generated a number of structural designs, however, many were unable to be built due to restrictions from P&F, or would have required engineering approval, which can take a considerable amount of time. The main limitations were that the structure could not hang above/over users or obstruct pre-existing pathways. 

						</p>
						<p>
							On Monday, October 14 (Week 12), there was a setback with construction of the structure. The CNC machine was unable to cut straight through the plywood. Consequently, each piece had to be individually chiseled out and sanded by hand.
						</p>
						<p>
							The structure was assembled and deployed on Wednesday, October 16 (Week 12). It was built from 9mm plywood and screws. Sections of the installations were lopsided due to the building site being on uneven terrain. The dullness of the plywood coupled with the visible knots and blemishes contrasted against the bright lighting display from flowers. 

						</p>
						<p>
							At first, the location of the structure was intended to be directly opposite E-Motion.  Music students expressed concerns about potential conflict between sounds and preferred to have the installation isolated from additional sources of noise pollution. After receiving approval from P&F, the structure was moved away from Bloom hub and further towards the University and REDROOM.

							</div>
						</div>

						<h3 id="floralevaluation">Evaluation</h3>
						<p>
								The structural complications that arose stemmed from the core materials that the structure was built from and the actual design of the structure itself being inadequate or flawed in some way. 

								
						</p>
						<div class="box alt">
							<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">

								<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="website/images/fs14.png" alt="" /></span></div>
							</div>
						</div>
						<p>
							There were boards of plywood that were screwed perpendicularly to connect and support each module. The size of the screws were the same width as the plywood, Consequently, when coupled with blind drilling, the outer layer of the horizontal plywood panels split. Furthermore, it rained heavily the weekend after the structure was built, resulting in water damage and causing the horizontal boards to bend. A few of the panels were so severely damaged that they fell off the installation. As a result of this, there were a multitude of exposed screws, raising an OHS concern. To ensure structural integrity, the structure should have been constructed from pinewood, connected by wood joints, and supported by timber connectors.

						</p>
						<div class="box alt">
							<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
								<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="website/images/fs15.png" alt="" /></span></div>
							</div>
						</div>
						<p>
							Due to the unfortunate coincidence that the deployment time period was one week before Halloween and the design of the structure being very unique, most users misidentified the flowers. Common responses were ghosts, hankies, or other observations relating to washing. The washing related identifiers may have been due to the multiple lines of twine that were elaborately strung across the structure.

						</p>
						<p>
							The first two nights (Tuesday, 22 October, and Wednesday, 23 October) of deployment, the installation garnered minimal engagement from passersby. Therefore, on Thursday, 24 October (Week 13), the 3D printed flowers were relocated from the main installation site and hung from the pandanus palms located in close proximity to the other two installations. 

						</p>
						<div class="box alt">
							<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
								<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="website/images/fs16.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
							</div>
						</div>
						<p>
							That afternoon, the number of people interacting with or taking photos under the pandamus palms was observed to be substantially higher than at the previous location. Multiple light projectors were set-up underneath the pandanus palms for the Bloom festival. There were concerns that this pre-existing lighting would interfere with the flowers, however, they instead served as an ambient luminous background and complimented the flowers nicely. 


						</p>
						<p>
							On the final day of deployment (Friday, 25 October) there was a power outage that affected all of Bloom hub. Due to the flowers being battery operated, the power outage did not affect the installation and it instead remained fully operational during that period. 
						</p>

						<h3 id="floralimprovements">Improvements to Floral Symphony</h3>
						<p>
							Floral Symphony enjoyed much success throughout deployment (Week 13) during the 2019 UQ Bloom Festival, with participants both engaging with the installation in the intended way and utilising it as a backdrop for their photos. That being said, there are improvements that can be made to the developmental process and final concept. For future projects, considerations should be made in regards to the target audience, the installation and location as a whole, and both the intended and possible unforeseen uses.

						</p>
						<p>
							Initially, the project team was made aware of the installation being required to be deployed for the full duration of the Bloom festival. To allow for this, the flowers were designed and made from fully weather-proof material. The primary reasoning for this was to protect the internal electronics from potential water-damage. However, there was little to no consideration for the structure itself being weather-proof, which was a key oversight. This was evident over the weekend between Week 12 and Week 13, when panels fell off the recently built structure due to heavy rains. Future projects should ensure materials used are durable under conditions of full weather exposure and long term stress to maintain structural integrity. 

						</p>
						<p>
							When the flowers were hung off the pandanus palms, spectators were seen to simply appreciate the aesthetics and used the space as an environment or backdrop for their photos. The ever-changing colours of the flowers coupled with static illumination from the light projectors welcomed a photo opportunistic atmosphere. Although the installation was received positively in terms of engagement with users, people were standing in the garden beds to take photos with the flowers. While not necessarily forbidden, the trodding on the flowerbeds caused unwanted environmental damage. While It is important to remember that the relocation of the flowers was a last minute decision to promote engagement, future projects should keep the surrounding flora and fauna in mind when selecting a location. 


						</p>
						<p>
							Each flower had been fit with an electronic core that housed a speaker. Once it was decided that the flowers would all play the same track, it would have been beneficial to reduce the number of total active speakers due to the close proximity of each flower to one another. By not having a speaker for each flower, the intended auditory effect could likely have been achieved more efficiently.

						</p>
						
<h3 id="floralconclusion">Conclusion</h3>
						<p>Overall, the special topic course DECO3000 provided students with the opportunity to collaborate on an interdisciplinary level. </p>
